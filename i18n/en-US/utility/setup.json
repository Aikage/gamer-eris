We don't just delete messages but we filter them and resend them. We hide the parts of the message that was profane with $$$ characters. This allows users to continue their conversation without having to retype the entire message. Imagine someone types a paragraph to give some feedback on your server and some bots just delete that entire message saying because of 1 word. This user now gets upset that all their effort to provide help and honest feedback is wasted and have to type it all again. Gamer makes sure that conversations stay intact and continue while maintaing a healthy atmoshphere in your servers by hiding the profanity.",
