The Discord staff are talking about the reason they limited group channels to only 10 friends. 📧 ```If we let everyone have unlimited channels, we can never have them use servers. We need them in servers so we can take over the world and make them into mindless zombies who will send emojis in chat 24/7.``` OH MY LORD! Discord staff is trying to make us all into mindless zombies that do nothing but send emojis all day every day. Their evil is exposed but we need even more proof and we need to find ways to stop their corrupt plans. You keep finding more friends and buy more stuff to grow this revolution. In the meantime, I will go leak this email on WikiLeaks 😉.",
